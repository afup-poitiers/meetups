# PAINLESS AUTHENTICATION WITH ACCESS TOKENS

Nous aurons le plaisir de recevoir Mathieu Santostefano qui nous fera dÃ©couvrir le composant AccessToken Authenticator de Symfony 6.2. 

## ðŸ“œ Description

Via some simple but real scenarios, we will discover the power of the new AccessToken Authenticator shipped in Symfony 6.2.

For example, we are developing a SaaS product, which exposes a private API. Our users can register many applications into their accounts, for each one we will generate an API Token that users must inject in their requests. 
<br>
Now, with a pinch of YAML and a dash of PHP, we will be able to authenticate users from their API Token. 

In this talk, I will show you how it also works with JWT and some other exotic tokens!
